# Contributing

Well, if anyone has found this project and wanted to contribute to it to enhance it, that would be so great and welcomed very much
however, don't be negative about the current architecture style, it's not something anyone would benefit from or appreciate
I know this is not the best architecture in the world but am doing this because I'm aiming to learn from it and I really hope it would 
help some one learn from it

### With that being said...

When contributing to this repository,
please first discuss the change you wish to make via `issue`, `email`, `or any other method` with me or any other contributors of this repository 
before making a change.

### When adding new validations

1. make sure you name the class name as follows `[TYPE OF VALIDATION]Validator` (ex.: ReachabilityValidator)
2. add typealiases above the class declaration as this one `typealias
3. make sure your class inherits from `BaseValidator`
